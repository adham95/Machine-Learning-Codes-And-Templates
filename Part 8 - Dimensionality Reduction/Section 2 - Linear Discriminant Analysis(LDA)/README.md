# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), normal discriminant analysis (NDA), or discriminant function analysis is a generalization 
of Fisher's linear discriminant, a supervised method used in statistics, pattern recognition, and machine learning to find a linear combination
of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting
combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.

Here we used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  to reduce dimensions of the dataset so that we can fasten 
the process of preictions and model training and plot graph of the DV and visualise the result.
