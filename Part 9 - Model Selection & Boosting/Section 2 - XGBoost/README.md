# XGBoost - Gradient Boosting Model with Decision Trees.

XGBoost is similar to Random Forest , but specific trees to use for prediction are picked using Gradient Descent providing much more accurate predictions.

# Key Features
XGBoost is specially used for large dataset due to the following reasons:

1. High Performance

2. Fast execution

3. All interpretability unchanged

# Implementation

In this section we will implement XGBoost Classifier to tackle a business problem where a bank wants to figure out the reasons for high Churn rates given details about customers.(Same dataset we used to train our ANN model)
