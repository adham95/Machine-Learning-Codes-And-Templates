# Apriori

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.

Here we used Apriori algorithm to optimize the Market Basket for Customers. It can be further scaled for recommendation system utilisation.
