# Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. 
Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.

In this section we will implement an ANN model to tackle a business problem where a bank wants to figure out the reasons
for high Churn rates given details about customers.
