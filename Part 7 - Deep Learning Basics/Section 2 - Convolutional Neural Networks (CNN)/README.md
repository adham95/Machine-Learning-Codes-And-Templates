# CNN
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks,
most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial 
neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.
They have applications in image and video recognition,
recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing, and financial time series.

Here we implement a CNN model for computer vision (we classify images using this model)

# CNN in Python
We will using keras from tensorflow to implement the CNN model.

# CNN in R
In the previous section, we used the powerful H2O package in R to build an ANN for a Business Problem.

If you use H2O to build a CNN for Computer Vision, H2O comes with a framework called Deep Water.

However, this Deep Water framework is still in early stage, and its final version hasn't be released yet.
