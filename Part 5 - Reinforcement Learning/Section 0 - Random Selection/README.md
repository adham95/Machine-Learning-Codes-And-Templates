# Random Selection
Random Selection is a naive algorithm we will use to solve a version of multi-armed bandit problem i.e. out of various ads we will figure out which version of the ad gets aximum clicks by an internet user.
This approach is implemented only to evaluate the performance of the other algortihms keeping the performance of this model as a base reference.
